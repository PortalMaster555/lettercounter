This is a programming challenge from the DailyProgrammer subreddit.
It can be found at https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/onfehl/20210719_challenge_399_easy_letter_value_sum/
This project uses C to count the "letter value sum". For example, the word "dog" contains the letters "d", "o", and "g". The values of each of these according to A1Z26 are 4, 15, and 7, respectively.The letter value sum of the word "dog" is thus 26.
This code is probably terrible, do not use it.
